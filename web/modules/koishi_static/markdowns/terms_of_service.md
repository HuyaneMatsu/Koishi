### 1. AGREEMENT TO TERMS

These Terms of Use constitute a legally binding agreement made between you, whether personally or on behalf of an
entity ("you") and Koishi Developer(s) ("developer", "we", "us", or "our"), concerning your access to and use of the
Koishi bot as well as any other media form, media channel, mobile website or mobile application related, linked, or
otherwise connected thereto (collectively, the "Bot"). You agree that by accessing the Bot, you have read, understood,
and agreed to be bound by all of these Terms of Use. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH ALL OF THESE TERMS OF USE, THEN YOU ARE
EXPRESSLY PROHIBITED FROM USING THE BOT AND YOU MUST DISCONTINUE USE IMMEDIATELY. Supplemental terms and conditions or
documents that may be posted on the website from time to time are hereby expressly incorporated herein by reference.
We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to make changes or modifications to these Terms of Use from time to time.
We will alert you about any changes by updating the "Last updated" date of these Terms of Use, and you waive any right
to receive specific notice of each such change. Please ensure that you check the applicable Terms every time you use
our Bot so that you understand which Terms apply. You will be subject to, and will be deemed to have been made aware
of and to have accepted, the changes in any revised Terms of Use by your continued use of the Bot after the date such
revised Terms of Use are posted. The information provided on the website is not intended for distribution to or use by
any person or entity in any jurisdiction or country where such distribution or use would be contrary to law or
regulation or which would subject us to any registration requirement within such jurisdiction or country. Accordingly,
those persons who choose to access the Bot from other locations do so on their own initiative and are solely
responsible for compliance with local laws, if and to the extent local laws are applicable. The Bot is not tailored to
comply with industry-specific regulations (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), Federal
Information Security Management Act (FISMA), etc.), so if your interactions would be subjected to such laws, you may
not use this Bot. You may not use the Bot in a way that would violate the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA). The Bot is
intended for users who are at least 13 years of age. All users who are minors in the jurisdiction in which they reside
(generally under the age of 18) must have the permission of, and be directly supervised by, their parent or guardian
to use the Bot. If you are a minor, you must have your parent or guardian read and agree to these Terms of Use prior to
you using the Bot.

### 2. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS

software, website designs, audio, video, text, photographs, and graphics on the Bot (collectively, the "Content") and
the trademarks, service marks, and logos contained therein (the "Marks") are owned or controlled by us or licensed to
us, and are protected by copyright and trademark laws and various other intellectual property rights and unfair
competition laws of the United States, international copyright laws, and international conventions. The Content and
the Marks are provided on the site "AS IS" for your information and personal use only. Except as expressly provided in
these Terms of Use, no part of the Contents and no Content or Marks may be copied, reproduced, aggregated, republished,
