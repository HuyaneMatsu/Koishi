# Sex

Even tho its name may imply, it is actually not an explicit command.
It just tells you `No sex`. There are multiple outcomes which could be called `tier`-s or `level`-s.
When rolling a higher level the command can output `Yes sex` as well.

To enhance spam the command has both `channel` and `user` based cooldown that limits the next roll's level to be
the same or lower than the previous one.
