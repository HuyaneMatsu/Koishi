    FAQ
</h3>

##### Cannot invite Koishi, she is at 100 / 100 guilds

Koishi will likely never be verified making the 100 guild limit stay.
Since there is a popular demand on theming Koishi bot, we may offer other bots as an alternative
(Like Flandre for example).

##### Prefix

Koishi has no old-style chat commands. Only slash (*and other application commands*)!

##### Not in member list, but her commands are present

This can happen if Koishi has no view-channel permission, but you have use-application-commands.

Since Koishi is added without any permissions, make sure to assign a role to her, **else she will stay invisible and
be forgotten by everyone. That will make her sad.**

*Koishi so meta!*

##### Commands do not show up

- Koishi was invited without `applications.commands` scope.
- You have no `use-application-commands` permission.
- The guild has 50+ bots.
- Discord client is derping, give it a restart.
